#Writing Data


#Saving Plots

* ggsave()
* export from Plots window
* pdf()

```{r}
gapminder = read.csv(path.expand("~/R.Lessons/data/gapminder_data.csv"))

pdf("Life_Exp_vs_time.pdf", width=12, height=4)
ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, colour=country)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# You then have to make sure to turn off the pdf device!

dev.off()
```

> Where is the pdf?


#Challenge 1 

Rewrite your ‘pdf’ command to print a second page in the pdf, showing a facet plot (hint: use facet_grid) of the same data with one panel per continent.

```{r}
pdf("Life_Exp_vs_time.pdf", width = 12, height = 4)
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, colour = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
p
p + facet_grid(. ~continent)
dev.off()
```

Still not working. ... ...
