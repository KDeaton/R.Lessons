Run lesson 4 so that history is loaded, because we're using the same "cats" matrix. 

#adding columns and rows

```{r}
age <- c(2, 3, 5)
cats
```

add new age vector to cats matrix. need to have same number of entries as rows.

```{r}
cbind(cats, age)
```

```{r}
nrow(cats)

length(age)
```

```{r}
cats$coat
```

```{r}
levels(cats$coat)
```

would get an error if you tried to add another row without modifying the factor first
to add another "level" to the factor "coat type" 

```{r}
levels(cats$coat) = c(levels(cats$coat), "tortoiseshell")
levels(cats$coat)
```

now its added. 

#now you can add another row to the matrix. 

```{r}

```
