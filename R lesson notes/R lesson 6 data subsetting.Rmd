First, let's create a matrix. 

```{r}
x <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 4.8, 7.5)
names(x) <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
x
```

#Accessing elements using indices

```{r}
x[1]
x[4]
```

To ask for multiple elements, need to use c()

```{r}
x[c(1,4)]
```
to leave out c() doesn't work.
```{r}
x[1,4]
```

#Challenge 1

Given the following code:

x <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 4.8, 7.5)
names(x) <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
print(x)

output:
  a   b   c   d   e 
5.4 6.2 7.1 4.8 7.5 

Come up with at least 2 different commands that will produce the following output:

  b   c   d 
6.2 7.1 4.8 

After you find 2 different commands, compare notes with your neighbour. Did you have different strategies?

```{r}

```
