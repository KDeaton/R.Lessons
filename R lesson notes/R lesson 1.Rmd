Challenge 2

What is age and mass? 

```{r}
mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.3
age <- age - 20
```

Challenge 3

Run the code from the previous challenge, and write a command to compare mass to age. Is mass larger than age?

```{r}
mass > age

```

Challege 4

Clean up your working environment by deleting the mass and age variables.

```{r}
rm(ls())
```

Retry

```{r}
list = ls()

rm(list)
```

Worked. Could have also used rm(age,mass)


Challenge 5

Install the following packages: ggplot2, plyr, gapminder

```{r}
install.packages("plyr", "gapminder")
```
