Challenge: Creating a self-contained project

skip because we're using github which does this already


Challenge 1: Download gapminder data

Downloaded from internet and then uploaded in the files window.


Challenge 2: 
Use the command-line shell to answer the following questions:

What is the size of the file?
How many rows of data does it contain?
What kinds of values are stored in this file?

#didn't know how to run this, but practiced using the answers. 


Challenge 3

Create a directory called "graphs". Modify .gitignore to include graphs/ so that it doesn't store disposable output. 

#don't know how to do this, the answer code didn't work
